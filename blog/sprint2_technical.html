    <h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1> 
    <p><b> Fixed</b></p>
    <p>fixed keeps everything on the page relative to the view port so essentially it'll stay the same when you scroll</p>
    <p><b>Static</b></p>
    <p>Static is postitioned in accordance with page flow and aren't effected by top bottom left or right</p>
    <p><b>absolute </b></p>
    <p>An element with postion absolute is always postitioned close to its nearest ancestor and if there are no ancestors it will use the document body  </p>
    <p><b>Relative</b></p>
    <p>an object with postion relative will sit relative to its normal postion and setting things like top bottom left or right will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal postition  </p>
