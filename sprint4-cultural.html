    <div id="culture3">
    <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
    
    <p>Understanding neuroplasticity is an important part of learning and once you understand it, it becomes undeniable proof that you can teach yourself anything</p>
    
    <h2>how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
    
    <p>In regards to neuroplasticity i might utilize repetition and use this to master what i'm looking to learn/do </p>
    
    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
    One of the big ones would be simple reppetition though for someone like me i think using meditation in conjunction with reppetition works wonders.</p>

    <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
    <p>Well a growth mindset is the belief that "a person's capacities and talents can be improved over time" and that with this particular mindset you are more likely to achieve desired results</p>
    <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
    <p>I wouldn't say that anything really supprised me though having someone else talk to you about such an idea does cement in my head prior beliefs, i guess the thing that changed is that the idea retains more clout now</p>
    <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
    <p>Oneway i will intergrate it is via setting reminders on my phone, i find that physical reminders of ideas for me tend to work, like post it notes over my walls</p>
