    <h1>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you</h1>

    <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p>After getting blocked on the later two Kata i began stressing and searched the internet for the answer and checking to see what others had done for similar questions 
    what i found is that though i had gotten half way on the last few Kata's easily i would reach a roadblock in my code and i couldn't solve the issue 
    reading the sample answer it occured to me tha perhaps i had started the code wrong and sabotaged myself from the begining 
    so it made me rethink how i was approaching and interpreting questions</p>
    
    <h2>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h2>
    <p>Don't consider alot of problemsolving to have elegance though if i were to choose it would be the first two kata as it happened rather quickly and without too much research</p>
    
    <h2> In both cases <h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>What was the problem?<h2>
    <p>"when given the array [3] super_fizzbuzz should return the array ["Fizz"]"</p>
    <h2> problem solving techniques did you use</h2>
    <p>I read the error messages,googling,i would try stuff i found,i made an attempt to rubber ducky my situaiton and a bit of pseudocoding</p>
    <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
    <p>I was rather stressed but then again i've been applying alot of self care methods and mindfulness exersizes </p>
    <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
    <p>I learn't how useful it can be to take time away from a problem if it's stressing me out and how cooling off and coming back to it can give me a better view on the overall situation </p>
    <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
    
    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
    <p>I wrote pseudocode out on some text files and it didn't really click for the kata's i was using it for </p>
    <h3>Trying something</h3>
    <p>probably the most useful one for me and i'm alright about it </p>
    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
    <p>i tried to explain what i was doing to my partner and it usually ended up in me grabbing tea and working on it afterwards</p>
    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
    <p>this is something i was using the most </p>
    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
    <p>Going to be honest i didn't do much of this at all </p>
    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <p>I did alot of googling</p>
    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
    <p>I'm shy if i'm honest </p>
    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
    <p>by the time would type something out i'd have figured out a less intrusive way to solve the issue or i would've figured it out</p>
    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <p>I'd say i'm doing that now and so far i've found reflection to be rather important in the learning process</p>
