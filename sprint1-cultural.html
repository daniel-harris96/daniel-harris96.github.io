    <h1>personal values</h1>
<h2> Describe personal values and ethics</h2>
<p>Hi i'm Dan, i'm passionate about discovery and finding new things to read about 
it plays into my ethics highly as it forces my view to be highly amorphus to a point 
where i can't be sated by a simple yes and no answer</p>

<p>I'm passionate about creation i find it cathartic 
it has pushed me to learn new skills so i might be able to further my creative goals 
which in turn is a net positive</p>

<h2> Myers briggs introspective self report:</h2>
<p>If you're taking the test as an accurate assumpiton of who i am
I am ISFP which has social strengths 
- I enjoy doing new things
- I'm an out of the box expert 
- i'm warm and accepting of others
- I'm very willing to help others in need 
</p>
<h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved
in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>

<p>Earlier in 2020 i was about to sit down to eat when my partner with no prior history of seziures began to fit 
as she started the fit she hit the ground rapidly with a thud, i picked her up off the ground and onto the bed 
where i noticed she had stopped breathing, as soon as i realized this i began making attempts to dislodge food
alot of my adv-first aid knowledge had expired and i was certain that alot of the things i was doing were dubious
i'm aware that it if i beat her back or do the helmlich i will be damaging her ribs as she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
where i can sublux and cause her alot of damage long term. 
Anyway i hulked out and caused alot of physical trauma to her in the process but i've still got her around
so i've got that to be happy about.</p>

<h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h2>

<p>I believe my culture or lack there of gave me a sense of exploration and a need to know more, 
alot of my childhood was a big question mark in terms of upbringing so it left a lasting impression on my life
so it's probably why i'm nosy like a bloodhound</p> 

<h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>

<p>I'm an easy person to get along with and i enjoy working in tight knit teams so coming together and helping 
others is something i'm proud to say i enjoy,
so far the hardest part with me is managing breaks and keeping the breaks in the work regime.
I tend to forget how necessary breaks can be and i am prone to burning out on a subject
due to not taking enough time to rest where i'll hyper focus on a target and get tunnel vision.</p>

<h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>

<p>I believe the ability to get on well with people will help with my ability to collaborate and perhaps
with another pair of eyes it can help keep me from tunnel vision.</p>

<h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time,
how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>

<p>whilst working at hobby city we'd have alot of repairs coming in for rc cars of various makes and we didn't 
really have an efficient way of keeping track of all the projects or noting what state the repair was in 
so someone would go away for their weekend and the rest of us would tamper with the car for a once over 
to see what the problem was, if there was a universally agreed upon system in place it would've caused alot less 
stress</p>
