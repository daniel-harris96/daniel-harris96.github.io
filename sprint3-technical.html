<h2>What is the difference between html and css? </h2>
<p>You can think of html as the builder and css as the painter and artist
html handles the groundwork of the coding where css is only there to add an extra layer of beauty to the website.

<h2>What is flow control and how are loops related?</h2>
<h3>Flow control tends to work similarly to reading a page top to bottom here's an example of how it might read</h3>
<h3>
Triceps & shoulders day
</h3>
<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>
<p>warm up on on crosstrainer for 5 mins</p>
<h3>
<b>Step 2</b>
</h3>
<p>seated dunbell shoulder press 3x8-12</p>
<h3>
<b>Step 3</b>
</h3>
<p>upright row 3x10-15</p>
<h3>
<b>Step 4</b>
</h3>
<p>
lat raises 3x10-15
</p>
<h3>
<b>Step 5</b>
</h3>
<p>overhead tricep extensions 3x10-15</p>
<h3>
<b>Step 6</b>
</h3>
<p>dunbell shrugs 3x10-20</p>
<h3>
<b>Step 7</b>
</h3>
<p> warm down on crosstrainer for 5 mins</p>
<h3>A good way to describe looping here is if i wanted to extend step one to 20 mins i'd repeat it about 3 times till i meet the 20 minute mark 
where i'd then begin to follow the rest of the steps though i could also loop step one indefinitely 
</h3>

<h2>Functions, why are they usefull?</h2>
functions are reusable lines of code that can be called upon as much as you like to complete tasks 

<h2>The Dom and Devtools</h2>
<p>The Dom also known as the Document Object model is an interface which displays all code in a tree like structure wheras
devtools are the other aspect of using a web browser where you can diagnose problems quickly, edit pages and ultimately
it helps speed up the process of development
