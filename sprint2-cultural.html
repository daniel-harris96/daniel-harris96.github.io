     <h2>what is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>

<p>My long term goal is to get comfortable in web development and to pick up skills that could both help me personally and in a working environment </p>

<h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>

<p>I want to work on my concerntration and to develop myself into someone who can assess and read a room </p>

<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>

<p>My strenghs are as follows, i enjoy tinkering with the mechanical stuff and seeing what else i can apply to it though i can get tunnel vision easily 
I enjoy the company of others though i find initiating conversations hard.</p>

<h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.<h2>

<p>In regards to my previous statement about tunnel visioning the way i'll be managing this is by setting timers and alarms for myself as i find physical reminders tend to get me on track, the dificulty i have with initiating conversations with people can be circumvented by contacting people through text. I need to make an effort to regularly socialize myself too, 
i found if i don't my social skills take a backseat to my technical skills. </p>

<h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>

<p>If i run into a wall i'll be contacting my tutor online though i'm running out of time i can contact someone from the slack channels for help</p>

<h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>

<p>I expect the facilitation team to do exactly that, facilitate and if i have trouble i can always contact them though on a side note the weekly calls have been good for me</p>
